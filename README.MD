This program was created as a utility for a program developed for scientific purposes, which produces results in a rather complex technical format.

My program is able to decipher and translate the arbitrary output of this program to an understandable and convenient for further manipulations LaTeX syntax.

At the moment, for this utility to work, it is necessary to insert the result of the program into the source line "str". After that, the converted code will be displayed in the terminal.
